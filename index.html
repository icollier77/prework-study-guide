        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The document should start with the document type proclamation.</li>
          <li>Next we have to specify the root i.e. "html".</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage via these elements: title, style, base, link, meta and script.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Information within the body is organized in sections.</li>
          <li>Images are void elements - they do not require the closing tag.</li>
          <li>The header element appears on the top of the page and contains navigation menu and introductory content.</li>
          <li>Paragraph element is p.</li>
          <li>Break is br (it's a void element).</li>
          <li>Elements can have attributes that specify something about them.</li>
          <li>Attributes are always placed within the opening tag.</li>
          <li>Other elements are ul for unordered list, ol for ordered list and li for list items.</li>
          <li>All these are semantic elements. There are also non-semantic elements such as div or span.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS; internal CSS style sheet; external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is most common as it allows the most flexible assignment of style and provides 'separation of concerns'.</li>
          <li>The CSS rules require a selector and a declaration. A declaration consists of a property and its value.</li>
          <li>If you want to apply the style ot all elements on the page, use a special selector: '*'. You can also list two or more selectors separated by a comma with the same style - this follows the DRY principle of programming: "Don't Repeat Yourself".</li>
          <li>Some CSS properties are margin, padding, width, height, color, background-color, text-align, margin-left, margin-right, display, padding-left, font-size.</li>
          <li>After setting a CSS style sheet, you have to link to it in the HTML file using a 'link' attribute within the 'head' element.</li>
          <li>You can also assign style not just to indivual elements, but to elements groupped into classes.</li>
          <li>A class selector is indicated in CSS with a dot preceding 'class'. When adding the 'class' element within HTML, the dot is not needed.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Note that feature/starter-code is a common format for a new feature branch name.</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area and says that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>git commit -m "your message here": commits the changes with a message; note that a message has to be imperative in present tense.</li>
          <li>git pull origin main: double-check that the local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub and pull down any changes from the base branch.</li>
          <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: push all changes from the local branch to the base branch.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Data types are: string, number, boolean, array, object. But note that every data type is an object in JS.</li>
          <li>Variables can be declared with let and var.</li>
          <li>Variables declared with let are only available within the block where they are defined.</li>
          <li>Variables declared with var are availabled throughout the funciton where they are defined.</li>
          <li>JS is weakly typed language - it means that it is smart enough to change the data type to fit the needs.</li>
          <li>Operators are the same except for strict equality (===) and not equal (!==).</li>
          <li>Real interactivity requires event handlers. The most common event handler is click event.</li>
          <li>You can use the ChromeDev console to test your code and functions. Use console.log() similar to print() to print output to console for verification.</li>
          <li>You can use conditional statements and loops for control flow.</li>
          <li>You can use arrays same as in C: arrayName[item1, item2, etc]. The array is indexed from 0. Array items are called arrayName[0], arrayName[1], etc.</li>
          <li>For loop has 3 parts: word for; 3-part conditional statement; code block.</li>
          <li>A 3-part conditional statement has the starting point var x = 0; condition based on the length of the array (x < length); iteration x++.</li>
          <li>You can declare a function as: function functionName().</li>
          <li>After defining the function, you have to call it in the appropriate place in your code.</li>
        </ul>
